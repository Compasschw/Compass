"""Pydantic v2 schemas for the CaseNote CRUD endpoints.

All schemas use ``from_attributes=True`` (ORM mode) where applicable so they
can be constructed directly from SQLAlchemy model instances.

HIPAA note: ``body`` is PHI.  It must only be returned to the authorised CHW
author or an admin; the router layer enforces this.  These schemas deliberately
do NOT include ``deleted_at`` on response types — soft-deleted rows are never
surfaced through the public API.
